# TiViT-Piano

TiViT-Piano is a video-based piano transcription system built on a ViViT-style
spatio-temporal transformer backbone with task-specific heads for pitch,
onset, offset, hand, and clef predictions. The model ingests tiled RGB video,
learns shared representations across time, and emits multi-label frame-level
logits that support both audio-visual training and downstream theory-aware
post-processing.

## Installation

TiViT-Piano targets Python 3.10+ environments with CUDA-enabled PyTorch
wheels pre-selected in `requirements.txt`. To install dependencies into a
virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements file pins Torch 2.8, TorchVision 0.23, Triton 3.4, and the
associated CUDA 12.x libraries so GPU execution works out of the box. If you
prefer CPU-only or alternative CUDA versions, adjust the Torch packages before
running `pip install`.

## Datasets

The configuration file and dataset loaders support both the OMAPS and PianoYT
collections. Each dataset resolver allows explicit paths in the YAML config and
falls back to environment variables when unset.

### Environment variables

Set one of the following to point at a directory that contains dataset
subfolders:

```bash
export TIVIT_DATA_DIR=/path/to/datasets
# or
export DATASETS_HOME=/path/to/datasets
```

When these variables are defined, the loaders expect `OMAPS/` and `PianoYT/`
children within the directory. If neither variable is set, the code searches the
paths declared in `configs/config.yaml` and finally falls back to
`~/datasets/<name>` or repository-local `data/PianoYT` when available.

### OMAPS

To train on OMAPS, update `configs/config.yaml` with `dataset.name: "OMAPS"`
and (optionally) provide `root_dir`/`annotations_root`. The loader resolves the
root using the priority order shown below:

1. Explicit `root_dir` from the config, if it exists.
2. `$TIVIT_DATA_DIR/OMAPS` or `$DATASETS_HOME/OMAPS`.
3. `~/datasets/OMAPS` as a final fallback.

Store media under split directories (for example `train/video_*.mp4`) and
provide manifest files when you want to subset clips; manifests are simple text
files with one clip stem per line and `#` comments allowed.

### PianoYT

The PianoYT loader mirrors the same resolution logic and also recognises
repository checkouts stored at `data/PianoYT/`. Expected structure:

```
PianoYT/
  metadata.csv
  splits/
    train.txt
    val.txt
    test.txt
  train/
    video_<id>.0.mp4
    audio_<id>.0.midi
  val/
  test/
```

If split text files are missing, the loader infers clip IDs by scanning the
split directories. Configure `dataset.manifest.*` or `split_*` keys in
`configs/config.yaml` to select subsets during training, validation, or testing.

## Quick start

1. Update `configs/config.yaml` with your dataset paths and experiment metadata.
   The default experiment writes logs to `logs/` and checkpoints to
   `checkpoints/` under the project root.
2. Launch training:

   ```bash
   python scripts/train.py --config configs/config.yaml
   ```

   Common overrides include `--train-split`, `--val-split`, `--max-clips`, and
   `--frames` for rapid experiments. Use `--debug` for verbose logging and
   `--smoke` to run a synthetic dry run without touching the datasets.

Checkpoints and TensorBoard summaries are emitted according to the `logging`
section of the configuration (for example `logging.checkpoint_dir` and
`logging.log_dir`).

## Evaluation

The calibration utilities sweep decision thresholds and can optionally dump raw
logits for later analysis:

```bash
python scripts/calib/eval_thresholds.py \
  --ckpt checkpoints/tivit_best.pt \
  --config configs/config.yaml \
  --split val \
  --thresholds 0.2 0.3 0.4 \
  --dump_logits --out_npz out/val_logits.npz
```

Provide `--prob_thresholds` or `--thresholds` to customise the sweep, and use
`--fixed_*` flags when calibrating only one head. When `--dump_logits` is set the
script saves NPZ files containing flattened logits for each requested head; the
NPZ artefacts can be rescored or re-evaluated without rerunning the forward
pass.

### Debugging mode

Pass `--debug` to any calibration or evaluation entry point (for example
`eval_thresholds.py`) to favour deterministic, single-process data loading when
investigating individual clips. Debugging mode forces
`num_workers=0`, disables `persistent_workers`, turns off pinned memory, and
prints an acknowledgement before dataset construction so you can confirm the
runtime surface has been adjusted.

To recompute the default operating points from scratch, run the streaming
calibration helper which emits running summaries to `calibration.json` and logs
reliability diagrams:

```bash
python scripts/calib/calibrate_thresholds.py \
  --ckpt checkpoints/tivit_best.pt \
  --split val \
  --max-clips 400 \
  --timeout-mins 20
```

The script honours dataset overrides from `configs/config.yaml` and stops early
when the optional timeout elapses while still persisting partial statistics.

## Autopilot training loop

For unattended experiments use `scripts/train_autopilot.py`. The helper applies
safe defaults to `configs/config.yaml`, alternates between short training
bursts, calibration sweeps, and evaluations, and writes the metrics for each
round to `logs/auto/results.txt` alongside per-round stdout logs. You can start
directly from calibration, skip the first training burst when resuming, or ask
the driver to fall back to a fast grid search if the thorough sweep fails.

```bash
python scripts/train_autopilot.py \
  --mode fresh \
  --first_step train \
  --first_calib thorough \
  --fast_first_calib \
  --burst_epochs 3 \
  --target_ev_f1 0.20 \
  --results runs/auto/results.txt \
  --ckpt_dir checkpoints \
  --split_eval val
```

Pass `--dry_run` to exercise the control flow without launching training or
calibration. Subsequent invocations with `--mode resume` keep the current
experiment name and reuse the latest checkpoints.

## Key-aware decoding

The theory decoder estimates a 24-key posterior using the Krumhanslâ€“Schmuckler
profiles from `theory/key_prior.py`, mixes the posterior with a uniform prior,
and rescales selected heads. You can export posterior traces and adjust the
prior strength, temporal window, and smoothing parameters directly from the CLI:

```bash
python scripts/theory_decode.py \
  --in_npz out/val_logits.npz \
  --out_npz out/val_logits_keyaware.npz \
  --apply_to onset,pitch,offset \
  --lambda_key 0.5 \
  --window_sec 3.0 \
  --save_key_posterior out/val_key_posterior.npz
```

The defaults match the configuration in `KeyPriorConfig`, but you can sweep
`--lambda_key`, `--beta`, `--rho_uniform`, and `--window_sec` to explore
alternative priors. Use the resulting NPZ files with
`scripts/calib/eval_thresholds.py --in_npz ...` to measure the impact of theory
aware decoding.

## Debugging & diagnostics

The repository includes several helpers for sanity-checking data and model
plumbing:

- `python scripts/check/test_loader.py` prints dataset statistics, verifies
  manifests, and checks tensor shapes for the configured split.
- `python scripts/check/test_forward.py` instantiates TiViT-Piano and runs a
  single forward pass to confirm checkpoint compatibility.

Refer to `docs/REPO_TREE.md` for an index of additional utilities, including
profilers, visualization scripts, and document generators. Combine these tools
with the `--debug`/`--smoke` flags when iterating on configuration changes.
